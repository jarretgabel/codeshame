Coding ain't easy and we all make mistakes. Sometimes those mistakes are hilarious because they break obvious convention or attempt to "reinvent the wheel." No developer is impervious to these mistakes. Shit happens when your coding drunk on whiskey at 3&nbsp;a.m. on a Saturday night. Trust me, I get it.

The real goal of CodeShame is to present solutions and documentation that adhere to better patterns and principles than the terrible code in question. There will be instances where code is so bad, there may be no obvious solution.

If you come across code that makes you shake your head or face palm, add it [here](https://github.com/robojack/codeshame) and make a pull request. Be sure to checkout the guidelines in the Readme.
