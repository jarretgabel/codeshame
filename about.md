Coding is hard and we all make mistakes. Sometimes those "mistakes" are hilarious because they break obvious convention or attempt to reinvent the wheel so to speak. No developer is impervious to these mistakes. Shit happens when your coding drunk on whiskey at 3a.m. on a Saturday night.

If you come across one of these "mistakes", add it here by [forking](https://github.com/robojack/codeshame) and making a pull request. Be sure to follow the guidelines. If you find shame in our codebase, let us know. We're humble enough to handle it.
